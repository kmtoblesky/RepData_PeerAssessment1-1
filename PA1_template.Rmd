# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1




## Loading and preprocessing the data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = T)



# create a subset with NA removed

dataNaOmit <- subset(data, is.na(data$steps) == F)



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


### 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day calculating the total
number of steps taken each day



library(plyr)

totalPerDay <- ddply(dataNaOmit, .(date), summarise, steps = sum(steps))



###

creating the plot

hist(totalPerDay$steps, breaks = 20, main = "Number of Steps",
xlab = "Total number of steps taken each day",
ylab = "Number of Days", col = "blue")




![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png)




### 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day


mean(totalPerDay$steps)


## [1] 10766





median(totalPerDay$steps)

## [1] 10765





## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the
average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

 calcluating the average
number of steps taken in each 5-minite intervals




averagePerInterval <- ddply(dataNaOmit, .(interval), summarise, steps = mean(steps))


r
plot(averagePerInterval$interval, averagePerInterval$steps, axes = F, type = "l",
col = "blue", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Average Number of Steps", main = "Average
Daily Activity Pattern")

axis(1, at = c(0, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400), label = c("0:00", "6:00", "12:00", "18:00", "24:00"))

axis(2)
```

### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains
the maximum number of steps?


averagePerInterval[which.max(averagePerInterval$steps), ]

##     interval steps

## 104      835 206.2





So it is the interval from 8:35 to 8:40


## Imputing missing values



### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the
total number of rows with NAs)

sum(is.na(data$steps))


## [1] 2304





### 2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
The strategy does not need to be sophisticated.
I will fill the NA with average value for that 5-min interval



### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the
missing data filled in.


imputed <- data


for (i in 1:nrow(imputed)) {

    if (is.na(imputed$steps[i])) {

        imputed$steps[i] <- averagePerInterval$steps[which(imputed$interval[i] ==
 
            averagePerInterval$interval)]

    }

}


imputed <- arrange(imputed, interval)





### 3. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values
differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact
of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?



## Calculating the total number of steps taken each day



totalPerDayImputed <- ddply(imputed, .(date), summarise, steps = sum(steps))




##
creating the plot



hist(totalPerDayImputed$steps, breaks = 20, main = "Number of Steps",
    xlab = "Total number of steps taken each day",

    ylab = "Number of Days", col = "blue")


![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](figure/unnamed-chunk-12.png) 



## Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
on the imputed dataset


mean(totalPerDayImputed$steps)

## [1] 10766



median(totalPerDayImputed$steps)
\
## [1] 10766


## test do these values differ from those in the initial section


abs(mean(totalPerDay$steps) - mean(totalPerDayImputed$steps))


## [1] 0




abs(median(totalPerDay$steps) - median(totalPerDayImputed$steps))/median(totalPerDay$steps)


## [1] 0.0001104

The mean did not change.  The median slightly changed about 0.1% of the original value.


##test how total steps taken per day differ


totalDifference <- sum(imputed$steps) - sum(dataNaOmit$steps)
totalDifference


## [1] 86130




## 
Impute the dataset causing the estimation on total steps per day to increase
.  Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?



### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and
"weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "English")

## [1] "English_United States.1252"


imputed$weekdays <- weekdays(as.Date(imputed$date))

imputed$weekdays <- ifelse(imputed$weekdays %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", 

    "weekday")




### 2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across
all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

##

calcluating the average for each interval


average <- ddply(imputed, .(interval, weekdays), summarise, steps = mean(steps))




##
creating the plot


library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | weekdays, data = average,
	layout = c(1, 2), type = "l",
	xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
